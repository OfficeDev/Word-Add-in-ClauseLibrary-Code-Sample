@* 
    ~/bundles/app is defined in App_Start/BundleConfig.cs.

    The following Scripts.Render(...) command will render all scripts
    defined under the "~/bundles/appcommon" bundle definition. The definition
    currently loads all *.js files in /Scripts/Controllers, /Scripts/Services,
    and app.js. Any .js files added to those directories will be automatically
    included, so there is no need to explicitly include them here.
